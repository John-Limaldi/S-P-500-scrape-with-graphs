# S-P-500-scrape-with-graphs
This is an introductory Data Science project. I used BeautifulSoup to scrape a website that contained performance data for 500 large companies since 1928. I put the data into a text file. Then I coverted the text file to a Pandas data frame. Then I plotted the average closing price, yearly open, yearly close, yearly high, yearly low, and percent annual change all against years using matplotlib.
