# S-P-500-scrape-with-graphs
This is an introductory Data Science project. I used BeautifulSoup to scrape a website that contained performance data for 500 large companies since 1928. I put the data into a text file. Then I coverted the text file to a Pandas data frame. I encountered an issue because the text file included the commas within the numbers, and I found out that the columns in the data frame were strings, so I could not graph them without casting everything to floats. Once the data was cleaned by removing the commas and casting the strings to floats, I was able to plot the average closing price, yearly open, yearly close, yearly high, yearly low, and percent annual change all against years using matplotlib. 

The Visualization shows that these companies started growing rapidly in performance after 2010. The data also displays the face that the annual percentage change remains pretty much constant, and does not spike over time, despite the spikes in the other data.
